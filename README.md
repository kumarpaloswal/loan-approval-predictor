# 🏦 Loan Approval Predictor

This machine learning project predicts whether a client’s loan should be approved based on various features like income, marital status, dependents, education, and more.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a binary classification model to assist in loan application filtering using historical client data.

## 🧾 Dataset Features
- Gender, Married, Dependents  
- Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome  
- LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term  
- Credit_History, Property_Area  
- Loan_Status (Target)

## ⚙️ ML Techniques
- Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation  
- Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest  
- Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Outcome
Trained and validated multiple models with consistent performance across folds using cross-validation.
